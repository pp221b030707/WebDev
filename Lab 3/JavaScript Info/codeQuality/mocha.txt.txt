3 tests are layed out as a single function with 3 asserts,
when error occurs it's less obvious what went wrong,
if an error happens in the middle of  a complex execution flow, we will have to debug the test
it is better  to block the test into multiple it blocks


describe("Raises x to power n", function() {
  it("5 in the power of 1 equals 5", function() {
    assert.equal(pow(5, 1), 5);
  });

  // Mocha will run only this block
  it.only("5 in the power of 2 equals 25", function() {
    assert.equal(pow(5, 2), 25);
  });

  it("5 in the power of 3 equals 125", function() {
    assert.equal(pow(5, 3), 125);
  });
});
