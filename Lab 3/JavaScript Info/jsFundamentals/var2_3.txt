const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?

const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?
Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? 
For age? Or even for both?

'birthday' can be used upper case, bcs it's hard-coded
hard-coded means the values is known prior to execution,
directly written into the coded
'age' is evaluated in run-time, the age changes every year->
better to use lower case
